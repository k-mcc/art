Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

Tonight I'm gonna have myself
A real good time, I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it
Inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So, (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me) 'Cause I'm having
A good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping
Through the sky
Like a tiger defying
The laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing
By like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Man outta you

(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way
To Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Woman of you

(Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me
Ooh, ooh, ooh) I like it
(Don't stop me, don't stop me)
Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah
Let loose, honey, all right


Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time
Just give me a call (Ooh, alright)
(Don't stop me now)
'Cause I'm having a good time (Yeah, yeah)
(Don't stop me now)
Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all

Ah, da da da da
Da da ah ah
Ah da da, ah ah ah
Ah, da da
Ah, da da ah ah
Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back
Bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you (I still love you)


Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh
