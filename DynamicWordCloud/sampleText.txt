Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
And that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

If I ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby

Ooooh, New York!
Ooooh, New York!

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Someone sleeps tonight with a hunger far more than an empty fridge

I'mma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New York!

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

In New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it from New York

I just want you close
Where you can stay forever
You can be sure
That it will only get better

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

When the rain is pouring down
And my heart is hurting
You will always be around
This I know for certain

You and me together
Through the days and nights
I don't worry 'cause
Everything's going to be alright
People keep talking, they can say what they like
But all I know is everything's gonna be alright

No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you, you, you
Can get in the way of what I feel

I know some people search the world
To find something like what we have
I know people will try, try to divide, something so real
So till the end of time, I'm telling you there ain't no one

No one, no one
Can get in the way of what I'm feelin'
No one, no one, no one
Can get in the way of what I feel for you

Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?

I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know

And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on

I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people

And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
[When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward]

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto

I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

She's just a girl, and she's on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
She's living in a world, and it's on fire
Feeling the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she's burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she's not backing down

This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl, but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try, but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we're burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we're not coming down

This girl is on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

Everybody stands, as she goes by
'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her when she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

This girl is on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire (Fire, fire)
This girl is on fire

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...
She's just a girl, but she's on fire

You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special, with the hot chocolate
And my manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water
But I always use some milk and cream for you
'Cause I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
'N your cuff links are shining all bright
So, whatchu do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look man, I mean I don't wanna waste your time, but...
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?

Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight, who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here and tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say, you should say it right now
(You should say it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

I know you said to me
This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gonna do something about it, we should do it right now
(We should do it right now)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful?
Either way, I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)
If you ask me, I'm ready (I'm ready)

Yeah, yeah
Sayin'
Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (Fly away)
I can't say, I can't compare
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wondering maybe, could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop

Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)

Said I'd be gone by five
But it's sunrise and I'm still in your bed
Goodnight usually means goodbye
Me, replaying memories in my head
Look at you, look at you
Look what you made me do
How do you, how do you think know my every move
Who are you? Who are you? You look so familiar
I know you, I know you, baby, I know the truth

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
Since I'm being honest with you

Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too
Who wants to love somebody like me?
You wanna love somebody like me?
If you could love somebody like me
You must be messed up too

We used to talk 'til midnight
All those days that you stayed at my house
We were just passing the time
When we were young and we ain't had no vows
Now, now, now maybe later on, I'll text you and maybe you'll reply
We both know we had no patience together day and night
Getting high on our supply, yeah, we ain't satisfied
I could love you all occasions

We got way too much in common
If I'm being honest with you
We got way too much in common
