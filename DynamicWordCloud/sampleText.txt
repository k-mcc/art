Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all


I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(Ooh)
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows

Tonight I'm gonna have myself
A real good time, I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it
Inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy
So, (Don't stop me now)

A good time, having a good time

The laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing
By like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way
To Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why
They call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic
Woman of you

(Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey

Love of my life, you've hurt me
You've broken my heart
And now you leave me

Love of my life, can't you see?
Bring it back, bring it back
Don't take it away from me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life, don't leave me
You've taken my love (all my love)
And now desert me

Love of my life, can't you see?
(Please bring it back, back) Bring it back
Bring it back, don't take it away from me
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember, when this is blown over
And everything's all by the way
When I grow older
I will be there at your side
To remind you how
I still love you (I still love you)


Back, hurry back
Please bring it back home to me
Because you don't know
What it means to me

Love of my life
Love of my life
Ooh, ooh

She keeps MoÃ«t et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
"Let them eat cake," she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke
Just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally
From Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
(Pa-pa-pa-pa)
Anytime


Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat

Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild . . 
She's all out to get you

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Ooh, let's go!

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go
Are you ready? Hey, are you ready for this?
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own
Are you happy, are you satisfied?
How long can you stand the heat?
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat
Look out

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust, hey
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey hey
Another one bites the dust, hey-eh-eh
Ooh

There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him, you can treat him bad
And leave him when he's down, yeah
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
Oh yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Shoot out
Ay-yeah
Alright

Buddy, you're a boy, make a big noise
Playing in the street
Gonna be a big man someday
You got mud on your face
You big disgrace
Kicking your can
All over the place, singing

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're a young man, hard man
Shouting in the street
Gonna take on the world someday
You got blood on your face
You big disgrace
Waving your banner
All over the place

We will, we will rock you (Sing it out)
We will, we will rock you

Buddy, you're an old man, poor man
Pleading with your eyes
Gonna make you some peace someday
You got mud on your face
Big disgrace
Somebody better put you back
Into your place

We will, we will rock you, sing it
We will, we will rock you, everybody
We will, we will rock you, hmm
We will, we will rock you, alright

(Radio)
(Radio)

I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly (Radio)
So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you

We watch the shows, we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years
Let's hope you never leave, old friend
Like all good things, on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio (Radio)

All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio goo goo, radio ga ga
All we hear is radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio, what's new?
Someone still loves you!

(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)
(Radio ga ga, radio ga ga)

You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

I've paid my dues
Time after time
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share
Of sand kicked in my face
But I've come through
(And I need to go on
And on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls
You brought me fame and fortune
And everything that goes with it
I thank you all
But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise
I consider it a challenge
Before the whole human race
And I ain't gonna lose
(And I need just go on
And on, and on, and on)

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions
Of the world

We are the champions, my friends
And we'll keep on fighting till the end, oh
We are the champions
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions...

Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score, on and on
Does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line
Does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on, yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance, on and on
Does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning
I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My makeup may be flaking
But my smile, still, stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday, grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill
I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the show
Show must go on
Show must go on

Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

Ooh, each morning
I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself in the mirror and cry)
Take a look in the mirror and cry

In believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

'Til the tears run down
From my eyes, Lord

Somebody (Somebody)
Ooh, somebody (Please)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
Oh

I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down

They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
(He's got) I got nobody left to believe
No, no, no, no


(Ooh, ooh, ooh, Lord)
Ooh somebody
Ooh (Somebody)
Anybody find me
Somebody to love
(Can anybody find me
Someone to love?)

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
(You just keep losing and losing)
I'm okay, I'm alright
(He's alright, he's alright)
I ain't gonna face
No defeat (Yeah, yeah)
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
(One day) Someday
I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
