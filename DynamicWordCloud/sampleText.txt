Back in the '90s, I was in a very famous TV show (Ooh)
I'm BoJack the Horse (BoJack!), BoJack the Horse
Don't act like you don't know

And I'm trying to hold on to my past
It's been so long
I don't think I'm gonna last
I guess I'll just try
And make you understand
That I'm more horse than a man
Or I'm more man than a horse
(BoJack!)

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you

Mean man, promised land
Nothing but a devil's hand
Trying to keep saying I feel okay
Telling myself this now for days

Mean man, machine man
I've been nothing but a puppets hand
But nothing ever comes
Without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

We're back in business
You're such a big mess
And I love you
Yeah, I love you
We're back in business
You're such a big mess

Been wondering, I take a chance
That chance is circumstance
Cause nothing ever comes without a change

Welcome to your life, yeah, yeah
It could be a fantasy, yeah, yeah
Welcome to your world, my girl
Let it be your fantasy, oh yeah

Yeah, I've figured it out, I've seen the unknown
Like a shot in the dark, I'll carry you home
Ask a wise man
He'll say what's been done
All the roads in this world
Were made by the young, by the young

Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
We're back in business
Hey, here's the deal
You're such a big mess
And I love you

I am a man, man man man
Up, up in the air
And I run around, round round
Round this town town
And act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown, brown, brown and blue
Yellow violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days
And know that I have changed

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands

So mistress, mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self
There's blood on the wall
Cause he couldn't face the truth
Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends
You'll be back again-gain
Before it's too late

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad

So I am a man, man, man, man
Up, up in the air
And I float around, round round
Round this town, town
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain
If everything's changed
Just know that you don't know

We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it
Oh yeah that's what we call it
Ohhh
Yeah that's right, we call it
Ohhh
We do it for love, sweet love

[Verse 1: Christian Zucconi)
I didn't ask for this
You give me heart attacks
I didn't want to care
And then I saw you there
Been working like a dog
I turned all my dreams off
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
[Chorus: Hannah Hooper & Christian Zucconi)
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Living in the back of a boat just like we do
Even when I dream all day

Don't wanna sleep tonight
You've got me feeling right
I didn't know my name, I didn't know my name
[Chorus: Hannah Hooper & Christian Zucconi)
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go
I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh (I got a ways to go)

Even when I can't see my rearview
Even if I call just to hear you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I work it like I'm times two
Living in the back of the bunk just like we do
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day

Oh I got a little bit longer, I got a ways to go-oh-oh
Whoa oh oh

Even when I smoke in the backroom
Even if I call just to meet you
Even when I sleep all day, even when I sleep all day
Even if I'm working like I'm times two
Waiting for the day just to end to see you
Even when I dream all day, even when I dream all day

Tell me that I've never been the same, I never noticed that
And nothing ever holds me, nothing ever holds me back
And it seems you never think of how I wanted you
Yeah, you say I'm someone, you say I'm something free

You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a life time living

So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about another
Know about the other side
So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about the other
Know about the other side

I can never seem to get all of my words across
But you say I'm someone, you say I'm something free
Yeah, I wish I saw myself the way you see me now
Cause you see that someone I always want to be

You had a lifetime living on your own time
You had a life time living

So tell me, do you love someone?
I'm losing all the time I had
I never had to know about another
Know about the other side

Can we keep walking 'til we're turning back the clock
Yeah, we can fight 'til there's nothing left to lose
Let's let it all come down

You remember that night when I hit a red light
And you pulled up next to me?
We were two young cats feeling under attack
Just making out in the street

It felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go

Yeah, you always took so right with your jeans all tight
Like you're walking in a magazine
Will you hold my hand, say you are my man
And you only have eyes for me?

Yeah, it felt so right, just you and I
Like this is something out of a dream
Since you been gone, don't know what I've done
You're just something like a memory

Am I stupid or do I want you back?
I don't know
Am I stupid or do I want you back?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go go go go

I think I been here before
It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
I'm feeling like it's only the lonely who know who we are

It doesn't matter
Hold me back, I'm coming in for more
