## Dynamic Word Cloud
The **Dynamic Word Cloud** generates a GUI based on the words in a given text file. The relative font size of each word in the GUI correlates to its frequency within the text file. Each word is assigned a random color, a random initial position, and a random velocity.

Run it yourself:
1. Create a copy of DynamicWordCloud.java (and sampleText.txt if you want to use it) on your device.
2. In DynamicWordCloud.java, replace `sampleText.txt` (line 25) with the name of a .txt file in the main method.
```java
String fileName = "sampleText.txt";
```
3. Run DynamicWordCloud.java
